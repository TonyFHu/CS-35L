download coreutils-8.29
use WinSCP to move to linux server
wget signature and keyring
gpg --verify...					
    "This key is not certified with a trusted signature!"
    "There is no indication that the signature belongs to the owner."
    
    The key used to sign is not trusted
tar -xzvf fileName				error; not in gzip format
tar -xvf fileName				decompress file
./configure --prefix=/.../			create Makefile for directory			
make	    					compile and create executables
make install					install executables into final directories
create the given shell script la
la -A						still outputs the directories . and ..
ls -a -A					also outputs . and ..
wget patch URL					didn't use quotes, so stopped at semicolon
wget 'patch URL'				worked this time
patch -p1 <....patch				failed to patch NEWS, successfully patched src/ls.c
make  	  					runs recursively on sub directories. 
	Leaves .../coreutils-8.29/po and .../gnulib-tests without doing anything
	,since no modifications to requisites were made.
(~/testing) ~/coreutils-8.29/src/ls -a -A		works as intended (no . and ..)
    outputs A B C
(~/testing) ls -a -A 			still buggy
    outputs . .. A B C
