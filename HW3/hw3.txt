1. Presumably, it improves the performance of ls, 
in the sense that ls is given more flexibility in its use. 
Instead of -a overriding -A, you can now choose which takes precedence.
   Not sure if I'm doing something wrong, 
but using the modified ls doesn't output color coded files, 
which could be seen as a downside/downgrade.


2. Conflict with existing usage or conflict with future versions of coreutils
when patching or otherwise. 
A diff file meant for the default coreutils likely
wouldn't work on the modified version..


3. The file is empty, so no line can be taken from it. 
The line "return seq[int(self.random() * len(seq))]" throws an exception 
since seq is empty.


4. With python3, automatic tuple unpacking was removed, so (errno, strerror) isn't unpacked into errno and strerror
